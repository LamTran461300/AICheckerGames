    "This purpose of this project/assignment is to create game-playing interface called checker (or draughts) using Pygame package that played with created with a programmed AI computer. AI computer can be made with the method of MinMax algorithms which mostly used in making board game interfaces. The first thing to initialize a constant value for the size of a board, checker pieces, and each square from the board. Addtionally, it is also important to give the checker game interface some color as well using RGB color code."
